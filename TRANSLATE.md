# Translations

PorphyStruct is currently available in: **English & German**. 

However if you want to contribute a translation, please have a look at this folder:
- [PorphyStruct.Properties.Language](https://github.com/JensKrumsieck/PorphyStruct/tree/master/PorphyStruct/Properties/Language)

You can find all language variables in the resx-Files. You can either provide a list of all language items in textformat 
or supply a pull request with your [Window].[Languagecode].resx Files.
It's recommended to use the Visual Studio Resource Editor for generating these files.
