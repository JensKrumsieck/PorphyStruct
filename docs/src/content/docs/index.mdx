	## Automated Conformational Analysis
	The conformation of tetrapyrrolic macrocycles significantly influences the reactivity and the (photo)physical properties. To analyse the conformation by creating displacement diagrams manually is possible, but costs a lot of time. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis is not easily possible. PorphyStruct offers automated creation of displacement diagrams and quantitative conformational Analysis using the NSD-technique.

	## Batch Processing
	The automated Analysis of thousands of structures is possible due to the implemented Batch processing feature. The Output will be merged into a csv file for further Analysis in Excel or as a Pandas DataFrame in Python scripts. Did you know? Some python scripts to Play with are available here: [porphystruct-scripts](https://github.com/jenskrumsieck/porphystruct-scripts).

	## Supported Macrocyclic Frameworks
	- Porphyrin (e.g. Isoporphyrins, Phtalocyanines, N-confused Porphyrins, Porphyrazines)
	- Corrole (e.g. Isocorroles, Heterocorroles, N-confused Corroles, Corrolazines, Corrins¹)
	- Norcorrole
	- Corrphycene
	- Porphycene

	¹ NSD-type analysis not useful for Corrins, but diagrams are still possible.
