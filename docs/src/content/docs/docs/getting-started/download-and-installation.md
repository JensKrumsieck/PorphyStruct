title: Download and Installation

### Getting Started with PorphyStruct

**PorphyStruct** currently is available for **Windows** (11 & 10, 7 seems to work, too) only, although there will be a solution in the future (e.g. a webversion). PorphyStruct uses .NET which is packed into the Executable, so there is no need to install any dependecies.

### Download

PorphyStruct can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/JensKrumsieck/PorphyStruct) by visiting the Releases Page, scroll down to "Assets" and Download the file named "PorphyStruct.exe":

**[PorphyStruct Releases](https://github.com/JensKrumsieck/PorphyStruct/releases)**

The Program is a portable Executable which means there is no installer. All that is necessary is to execute `PorphyStruct.exe`. This ensures you can use PorphyStruct even without to rights to install any software e.g. on a university computer or at work. PorphyStruct will write a Settings File (`settings.json`) on first launch, which will be located at `C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\PorphyStruct`. The (optional) automatic updater also uses this location for downloads if activated.
