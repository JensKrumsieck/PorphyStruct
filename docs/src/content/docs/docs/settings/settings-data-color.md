### General

#### Treat XYZ as Metal
This option exists for Si, P and B Atom types because these atoms can occur in the perimeter atoms (e.g. Heterocorroles) and as a coordinative center. Switch these options of if you want to analyze complexes of any of these atoms (Si, P, B). Switch it off if you are dealing with e.g. Silacorroles, Phosphacorroles or Boracorroles.

#### Not Marked Points
A comma separated list of all atoms that should not be marked with a marker in displacement diagrams. Accepts either Element + Number (C1) or all of specific element (C). Image shows result for value equal to "C".

#### Use Extended Basis (obsolete)
Uses Extended Basis for all analysis. Has been made obsolete in Version 1.0.2.

#### 3D: Non macrocyclic opacity
Opacity value of non perimeter atoms after detection in 3D representation.

### Experimental / Simulation / Comparison
#### Marker Color
Color of Atoms when option "[Use Single Marker Color](/docs/settings-graph#use-single-marker-color)" is set. For comparisons a list for Marker and Bond Color is given.  

#### Marker Type
Switches Shape of the marker (atoms). (default: circle) Image shows result for "Triangle"

#### Bond Color
Sets the color of the bonds in displacement diagrams. For comparisons a list for Marker and Bond Color is given.

#### Simulation Opacity
Opacity of the simulations displacement diagram representation.
